# push-adyen-collections-to-postman-javascript-action

This action will push [the latest Adyen collections](https://github.com/jlengrand/adyen-openapi) to Postman.
The action does not work in isolation and should be used as follow up the postman generation action. See https://github.com/jlengrand/adyen-openapi/pull/1 currently.

**[WIP] public repository but not made to be used by anyone else. It's a specific action that cannot really be reused as such**
